# hello-world.
It is a bit challenging to try and explain what I don't know yet. To sum up I would say something like "Our today's actions are our tomorrow's memories".

Hi bros !
Abdarou here, I really like very much WordPress and Divi lazy website makers (At least this is what I think I was made for). I've had couscous on the moon and find it far inferior to Kabira's.
I've been trying since years to get hold of WordPress secrets but haven't succeeded yet. I am 62 now and if my memory is still working correctly I joined the WP since I was 52. It is certainly a while now and still can't really master the beast ;-)
